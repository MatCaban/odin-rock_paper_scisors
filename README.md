# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game is played against the computer. The computer's choices are randomly generated.

## How to Play

1. Choose either rock, paper, or scissors by clicking the corresponding button.
2. The game will display your choice and the computer's choice.
3. The game will determine the winner of the round based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
4. Points are awarded based on the result of the round: one point for a win, and one point for a draw.
5. The game continue until someone scores 5 points. You can play another game by clicking your new choice.

## Code Structure

- `getComputerChoice()`: This function generates a random choice for the computer.
- `getUserChoice(e)`: This function gets the user's choice when a button is clicked.
- `playRound()`: This function plays one round of the game. It compares the choices made by the user and the computer to determine the winner.
- `playGame()`: This function manages the game. It calls `playRound()` to play a round, updates the scores, and displays the results.

## Future Improvements

- Add a user interface to start and stop the game.
- Keep track of the number of games won, lost, and drawn.
- Add animations or sound effects for a more engaging user experience.
